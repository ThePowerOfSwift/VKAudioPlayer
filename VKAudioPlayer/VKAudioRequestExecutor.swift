// Only last added request is executed. If there are other requests, they are canceled.
// This beheviour is useful if you want to stick to VK's restrictions of maximum number of requests per second and
// not to wait while all of your previous requests to be executed (e.g. live searching). If it's essential for you to
// execute every single request and you want to stick to VK's restrictions, i reccomend to look at VKRequestScheduler
